<!--  
 <pi id ="About_txt">I'm Michael Johnson, a computer science major at Clemson University. Ever since I was a child, I've been obsessed with cycling.  As I grew up riding bikes, I witnessed the progression of cycling technology as it grew up alongside me. From steel to aluminum to carbon, hydraulic brakes, and electronic groupsets. It was amazing to watch the blisteringly fast pace at which the industry grew.  Even with all the amazing things that have been developed in the last decade, I still believe that bike tech still has a very long way to go. It is my dream to be part of the future of cycling. To design the next generation of bikes and make things faster, lighter, cheaper, and more reliable than they have ever been is what drives me. I believe that my experience in engineering, programming, fabrication, and research and development could prove an invaluable asset to your company in paving the way to the future for cycling.</p>

  <p id="About_txt"> I am an undergraduate mechanical engineering student at Clemson University. I have experience in multiple engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering. I enjoy solving difficult technical problems and learning new things along the way. Give me a task and I will find a way to complete it. I like to try new things and I won't stray away from doing something out of my comfort zone. In my free time, I love to spend time maintaining and riding bikes of all disciplines, programming, metalwork, and building small electronics. </p>

 <p d="About_txt">   Hello, I'm Michael Johnson, a sophomore in computer science at Clemson University. My love for problem-solving and efficiency drives me to create lightweight, streamlined, and intuitive programs to achieve all sorts of goals in both my day-to-day life and professional environment. Fluent in C, C++, JS, SH, Python, Go, VisualBasic, Matlab, CSS, and Html, I come equipped with the tools and resources to tackle any problem you can throw at me.</br>
In addition to my passion for programming, I devote my free time to competitive cycling. Through hard work, structured training, and perseverance, I have been able to compete at a national level in both collegiate and open fields in multiple disciplines. I apply my drive and dedication in cycling to all aspects of my life, especially work. If you present me with a problem to be solved or a goal to be achieved, I will put all my effort forth to not only meet your expectations, but to exceed. To learn, adapt, and overcome brings me great joy and thus I pride myself in being flexible in my thinking and multifaceted in my skill-set.
 </br>
In addition to my current enrollment in the school of computer science, I studied mechanical engineering for two years at Clemson. This provides me with valuable interdisciplinary skills and education that few other candidates might posses. Knowledge of machining processes, product development, physics, and thermodynamics give me a more concrete understanding of the limitations and possibilities one might encounter in a project. Do you need someone to build a prototype for a product or a test rig for some software? I have over three years of experience in a machine shop fabricating things using mills, lathes, cnc machines, laser cutters, 3-D printers, and various other fabrication processes. 
</br>
No matter what problem you might face, I guarantee I will prove a valuable asset to your team.
