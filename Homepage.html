  <p id="About_txt"> I am an undergraduate mechanical engineering student at Clemson University. I have experience in multiple engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. I enjoy solving difficult technical problems and learning new things along the way. Give me a task and I will find a way to complete it. I like to try new things and I won't stray away from doing something out of my comfort zone. In my free time, I love to spend time maintaining and riding bikes of all disciplines, programming, metalwork, and building analog synthesizers. </p>
